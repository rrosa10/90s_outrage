        <p>Night Trap was one of the games at the center of a high-profile controversy about video game violence and content in the early 1990s. The controversy was fueled by concerns from parents and lawmakers that the game's themes and imagery were inappropriate for children.The controversy surrounding Night Trap and other video games, including Mortal Kombat, led to congressional hearings, during which the video game industry was questioned about the need for regulation. As a result of these hearings, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was established.
